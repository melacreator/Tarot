      <h1>Blind Spot Tarot Reading</h1>
      <p>
        This tarot spread is designed to help you uncover and understand your
        blind spots — those aspects of yourself or your situation that you may
        not be fully aware of. By revealing these hidden influences, the reading
        aims to provide clarity and guidance for personal growth and
        decision-making.

        <div>
          <p class="firstCard">
            The first card reflects the truth you are aware of — what you
            consciously acknowledge in your life. It shows your current
            perspective and the patterns you can clearly identify.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="secondCard">
            The second card reveals what you are overlooking, either out of
            fear, habit, or denial. It highlights hidden influences or truths
            that affect your choices without your awareness.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="thirdCard">
            The third card offers guidance on how to navigate the situation. It
            points toward actions, attitudes, or perspectives that can help you
            respond wisely and consciously."
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="fourthCard">
            The last card shows what could emerge if you integrate awareness of
            your blind spot. It represents growth, hidden opportunities, or
            outcomes that remain unseen until you act.
