      <h1>Blind Spot Tarot Reading</h1>
      <p>
        This tarot spread is designed to help you uncover and understand your
        blind spots — those aspects of yourself or your situation that you may
        not be fully aware of. By revealing these hidden influences, the reading
        aims to provide clarity and guidance for personal growth and
        decision-making.

            This card reflects the truth you are aware of — what you consciously
            acknowledge in your life. It shows your current perspective and the
            patterns you can clearly identify.

          <p class="secondCard">
            This card reveals what you are overlooking, either out of fear,
            habit, or denial. It highlights hidden influences or truths that
            affect your choices without your awareness.

            This card offers guidance on how to navigate the situation. It

            This card shows what could emerge if you integrate awareness of your
            blind spot. It represents growth, hidden opportunities, or outcomes
            that remain unseen until you act.
